Malestrom
===
This crate is inspired by reading about the [LMAX disruptor](https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/) pattern and also the technical interest in creating a multiple producer multiple consumer channel in rust. This project is a more serious attempt at a MPMC than my simple quick-n-dirty [channel-broadcast](https://github.com/kvsari/channel-broadcast) project.
